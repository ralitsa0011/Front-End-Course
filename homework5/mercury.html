                        Mercury is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar
                        size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other
                        respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96%
                        carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, or roughly
                        the pressure found 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar
                        System, with a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F), even though Mercury is closer to the
                        Sun.

                        Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbital period around the Sun of
                        87.97 days is the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity
                        Mercury, the messenger of the gods. Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an
                        inferior planet, and never exceeds 28° away from the Sun when viewed from Earth. This proximity to the
                        Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western or eastern horizon during the early evening or
                        early morning. At this time it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult
                        to observe than Venus.
